  - class_name: WorldSettings
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      The simulation has some advanced configuration options that are contained in this class and can be managed using carla.World and its methods. These allow the user to choose between client-server synchrony/asynchrony, activation of "no rendering mode" and either if the simulation should run with a fixed or variable time-step. Check [this](adv_synchrony_timestep.md) out if you want to learn about it. 
    # - PROPERTIES -------------------------
    instance_variables:
    - var_name: synchronous_mode
      type: bool
      doc: >
        States the synchrony between client and server. When set to true, the server will wait for a client tick in order to move forward. It is false by default. 
    - var_name: no_rendering_mode
      type: bool
      doc: >
        When enabled, the simulation will run no rendering at all. This is mainly used to avoid overhead during heavy traffic simulations. It is false by default. 
    - var_name: fixed_delta_seconds
      type: float
      doc: >

        type: bool
        default: False
        doc: >
          Set this to true to completely disable rendering in the simulation.
      - param_name: fixed_delta_seconds
        type: float
        default: 0.0
        param_units: seconds
        doc: >

      doc: >
        Creates an object containing desired settings that could later be applied through carla.World and its method **<font color="#7fb800">apply_settings()</font>**.

    # --------------------------------------

  - class_name: AttachmentType
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      Class that defines attachment options between an actor and its parent. When spawning actors, these can be attached to another actor so their position changes accordingly. This is specially useful for sensors. [Here](ref_code_recipes.md#attach-sensors-recipe) is a brief recipe in which we can see how sensors can be attached to a car when spawned. Note that the attachment type is declared as an enum within the class. 
      
    # - PROPERTIES -------------------------
    instance_variables:
    - var_name: Rigid
      doc: >
        With this fixed attatchment the object follow its parent position strictly. This is the recommended attachment to retrieve precise data from the simulation.  
    - var_name: SpringArm
      doc: >
        An attachment that expands or retracts the position of the actor, depending on its parent. This attachment is only recommended to record videos from the simulation where a smooth movement is needed. SpringArms are an Unreal Engine component so [check this out](ref_code_recipes.md#attach-sensors-recipe) to learn some more about them. <br><b style="color:red;">Warning:</b> The <b>SpringArm</b> attachment presents weird behaviors when an actor is spawned with a relative translation in the Z-axis (e.g. <code>child_location = Location(0,0,2)</code>).  
    # --------------------------------------

  - class_name: World
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      World objects are created by the client to have a place for the simulation to happen. The world contains the map we can see, meaning the asset, not the navigation map. Navigation maps are part of the carla.Map class. It also manages the weather and actors present in it. There can only be one world per simulation, but it can be changed anytime. 
    # - PROPERTIES -------------------------
    instance_variables:
    - var_name: id
      type: int
      doc: >
        The ID of the episode associated with this world. Episodes are different sessions of a simulation. These change everytime a world is disabled or reloaded. Keeping track is useful to avoid possible issues.  
    - var_name: debug
      type: carla.DebugHelper
      doc: >

          A defined function with a snapshot as compulsory parameter that will be called every tick.  
      doc: >
        The method will start callbacks for a defined function `callback`. It will return the ID for this callback so it can be removed with **<font color="#7fb800">remove_on_tick()</font>**.
    # --------------------------------------
    - def_name: remove_on_tick
      params:
      - param_name: callback_id

        doc: > 
          Maximum time the server should wait for a tick. It is set to <code>10.0</code> by default.   
      doc: >
        This method only has effect on synchronous mode, when both client and server move together. The client tells the server when to step to the next frame and returns the id of the newly started frame.

      doc: >
        The method will create, return and spawn an actor into the world. The actor will need an available blueprint to be created and a transform (location and rotation). It can also be attached to a parent with a certain attachment type.

The method does not take into consideration locations of existing actors so if a collision happens when trying to spawn an actor, it will return an error. Take a look at [`spawn_npc.py`](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/e73ad54d182e743b50690ca00f1709b08b16528c/PythonAPI/examples/spawn_npc.py#L179) for an example.
