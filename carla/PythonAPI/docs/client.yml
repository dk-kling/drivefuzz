  # - CLASSES ------------------------------
  classes:
  - class_name: Client
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      The Client connects CARLA to the server which runs the simulation. Both server and client contain a CARLA library (libcarla) with some differences that allow communication between them. Many clients can be created and each of these will connect to the RPC server inside the simulation to send commands. The simulation runs server-side. Once the connection is established, the client will only receive data retrieved from the simulation. Walkers are the exception. The client is in charge of managing pedestrians so, if you are running a simulation with multiple clients, some issues may arise. For example, if you spawn walkers through different clients, collisions may happen, as each client is only aware of the ones it is in charge of.

        The client also has a recording feature that saves all the information of a simulation while running it. This allows the server to replay it at will to obtain information and experiment with it. [Here](adv_recorder.md) is some information about how to use this recorder.

  - class_name: TrafficManager
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      The traffic manager is a module built on top of the CARLA API in C++. It handles any group of vehicles set to autopilot mode to populate the simulation with realistic urban traffic conditions and give the chance to user to customize some behaviours. The architecture of the traffic manager is divided in five different goal-oriented stages and a PID controller where the information flows until eventually, a carla.VehicleControl is applied to every vehicle registered in a traffic manager.

      type: float
      param_units: meters
      doc: >
        Max road length for a single mesh portion. The mesh of the map is divided into portions, in order to avoid propagating issues. __Default is `50.0`__.
    - var_name: wall_height
      type: float
      param_units: meters
      doc: >
        Height of walls created on the boundaries of the road. These prevent vehicles from falling off the road. __Default is `1.0`__.
    - var_name: additional_width
      type: float
      param_units: meters
      doc: >
        Additional with applied junction lanes. Complex situations tend to occur at junctions, and a little increase can prevent vehicles from falling off the road.  __Default is `0.6`__.
    - var_name: smooth_junctions
      type: bool
      doc: >
        If __True__, the mesh at junctions will be smoothed to prevent issues where roads blocked other roads. __Default is `True`__.
    - var_name: enable_mesh_visibility
      type: bool
      doc: >
        If __True__, the road mesh will be rendered. Setting this to __False__ should reduce the rendering overhead.  __Default is `True`__.
    - var_name: enable_pedestrian_navigation
      type: bool
      doc: >
        If __True__, Pedestrian navigation will be enabled using Recast tool. For very large maps it is recomended to disable this option. __Default is `True`__.
